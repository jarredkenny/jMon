jMon
==============

jMon is a simple server monitor written in PHP and Bash. jMon takes a different approch to server monitoring. Instead of querying a server's services from the monitor, the monitor simply parses data sent to it by a script installed on the server that is being monitored. This data contains server statistics such as uptime, disk usage, ram usage, load, and more. A threshold can be configured for each value to trigger an alert. If the monitor does not receive an update from the server in a given amount of time, you will then be alerted as well.
